I had some N-body newtonian simulation code which I have been meaning to put into a nice graphics renderer for a while. I want to improve the look and there are also some serious issues with the simulation which means Mercury gets ejected(who needs it..)

I need to add a little UI so you can add and remove bodies and restart the simulation
